# Water Rocket electronics Arduino code
This is the code of an Arduino project that contains 
* Arduino Pro Mini
* SD card module
* 10 DOF module with L3GD20, LSM303D, BMP180 (Gyro,Accelerometer,Compass,Altimeter)
* Servo

Aim of the project is to
- detect launch
- detect highest altitude
- trigger parachute release mechanism (based on servo)
- log everything to SD
